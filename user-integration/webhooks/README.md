# Webhooks

## Description

Webhooks allow you to build or set up Applications which subscribe to certain events on Fractal ID. When one of those events is triggered, we'll send a HTTP `POST` payload to the webhook's configured URL.

## Terminology

* Callback URL - the URL of the server that will receive the webhook `POST` requests.
* Secret token - token that allows you to ensure that `POST` requests sent to the callback URL are from Fractal. Each [webhook type](available-types.md) has an associated secret token.
* Notification - webhooks `POST` request which is triggered by certain events on Fractal ID.
